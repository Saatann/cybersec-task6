## Passwords Tested

| Password          | Tool Used                 | Score (%) | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `apple`           | passwordstrengthmeter.com | 10%       | 0.01 seconds         | Too short, only lowercase        |
| `Apple123`        | passwordstrengthmeter.com | 52%       | 1 hour               | Common pattern, add symbols      |
| `App!e1234`       | passwordstrengthmeter.com | 75%       | 4 days               | Better – has symbol, long enough |
| `A@9eLq#1Zt!4`    | passwordstrengthmeter.com | 100%      | 100+ years           | Strong – uses all types, long    |
| `A9$kL!82eWx#U@d` | passwordstrengthmeter.com | 100%      | 343 trillion years   | Excellent – very high entropy    |

## Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

1. Use **12+ characters**.
2. Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
3. Avoid **dictionary words or predictable sequences**.
4. **Randomness** increases password entropy.
5. Use a **password manager** for generation and storage.

## Common Password Attacks

* **Brute Force:** Tries every possible combination. Short/simple passwords are vulnerable.
* **Dictionary Attack:** Uses a precompiled list of common passwords/words.
* **Credential Stuffing:** Uses leaked credentials from other data breaches.

**Takeaway:** Password complexity significantly improves resistance to attacks.
